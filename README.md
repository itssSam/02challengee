## Description 

My motivation for building this project stemmed from a desire to help different businesses to grow on three main aspects. The search engine optimization, the online reputation management and the social media marketing. I felt inspired to lauch this project because I used to have a real estate business and I know how hard it is to generate leads for your own business, for example. That's why this project is addressed to those many businesses that are willing to take it to the next level and generate a lot more leads, for example. During this project, I learned that the web is a really large platform that it could be used to its best with the right tools.
